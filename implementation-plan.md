# MO-180 Sales Simulator Implementation Plan

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
  - Chosen for component-based architecture, state management, and widespread adoption
  - Create React App for quick setup and build configuration
  
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI or Bootstrap
  - Provides responsive design components
  - Includes form controls, sliders, and panel components

- **State Management**: React Context API (or Redux for more complex state)
  - Manage application state across components
  - Store user inputs and calculated results

- **PDF Generation**: react-pdf or jsPDF (Phase 2)
  - Generate downloadable reports

- **Internationalization**: react-i18next (Phase 2)
  - Support for English and Japanese languages

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

#### 1. Project Setup (Week 1)
- Initialize React application
- Set up project structure
- Configure build process
- Create repository and version control

#### 2. Core Calculation Module (Week 1-2)
- Implement calculation utility functions:
  - Item layout calculation (items per print job)
  - Ink usage estimation
  - Cost calculations
  - Profit and payback period calculations
- Unit test calculations with reference data
- Implement input validation logic

#### 3. UI Development (Week 2-3)
- Create responsive layout with two-panel design
- Build InputPanel component with all required inputs:
  - Product dimensions (short/long edge)
  - Price inputs (sales price, costs)
  - Volume slider
- Build ResultsPanel component:
  - Display all calculated metrics
  - Implement conditional styling based on payback period
- Implement real-time recalculation

#### 4. Testing & Refinement (Week 3)
- Comprehensive testing with various input scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Bug fixes and UI polish

#### 5. Documentation & Deployment (Week 4)
- Update README with usage instructions
- Document code and calculations
- Prepare for deployment
- Deploy Phase 1 version

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### 1. Configuration Externalization (Week 5)
- Move printer parameters to external JSON configuration
- Create architecture for supporting multiple printer models
- Implement model selection UI

#### 2. Internationalization (Week 5-6)

- Design PDF template with inputs and results
- Enable "Download PDF" button

#### 4. Scenario Analysis (Week 7)
- Implement scenario saving/loading functionality
- Create UI for managing multiple scenarios
- Add comparison visualization

#### 5. Advanced Visualization (Week 7-8)
- Implement charts and graphs:
  - Cost breakdown pie chart
  - Payback period timeline
  - Monthly profit projection

#### 6. Optional Features (Week 8+)
- Region-based configuration
- Lead generation form
- Advanced UI/UX refinements

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For calculation functions and utilities
- **Component Tests**: For UI components
- **Integration Tests**: For complete application workflow
- **User Testing**: With sales team and potential customers
- **Calculation Validation**: Compare results with expected values from the reference data

## Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Internal review and testing
- **Production**: Public-facing deployment
- Consider hosting options:
  - Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify)
  - Company servers
  - Cloud services (AWS, Azure, etc.)
